## About me

 I like to code because it's fun and I can make things.
 
 I'm good at data manipulation and performance optimization.
 
 I'm a hardcore (not good, just dedicated) terminal and vim user. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ziap/dotfiles).

## Notable projects

[2048 AI](https://github.com/ziap/2048-ai): A very efficient [expectimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectiminimax) 2048 player written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly.

[Repalette](https://github.com/ziap/repalette): A web application and CLI utility that theme images to a certain color palette with dithering. Written in C and compiled to raw WebAssembly for maximum performance on the web.

[Ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/ziap/uttt): A browser-based Ultimate tic-tac-toe game with a powerful Monte Carlo tree search AI adversary.

[Infinite minesweeper](https://github.com/ziap/infinite-minesweeper): A minesweeper game on an infinite board, written in JavaScript. Not very optimized code so I'll rewrite it in the future.

Many other small projects and more to come.
