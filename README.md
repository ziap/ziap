## âœ¨ About me

 - I like to code things from scratch and optimize my workflow.
 - I can write wep apps, .NET apps, mobile app and make games with VanillaJS canvas, Pygame or Unity.
 - I really enjoy low level coding, optimizing my code, working with images and graphics, and building user interfaces.

## ðŸ§° Things I work with

I use C++ for computational heavy stuffs, Python for web scraping and data science, Rust for web servers and interactive applications, and JavaScript for front-end web development.

## ðŸ’» Projects

- [2048 AI](https://github.com/ziap/2048-ai): A very efficient [expectimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectiminimax) 2048 player written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly.
- [Image themer](https://github.com/ziap/image-themer): A web application that theme images to a certain color palette using [Floydâ€“Steinberg dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering).
- [Infinite minesweeper](https://github.com/ziap/infinite-minesweeper): A minesweeper game on an infinite board, written in JavaScript. Not very optimized code so I'll rewrite it in the future.
- [Snake game](https://github.com/ziap/snake-game): My first game written in JavaScript and Canvas. It also has animations.
- Many other small projects and more to come.
